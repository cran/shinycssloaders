\description{
Add automatic loading animations to your Shiny outputs (e.g. plots, tables) by adding a single function call
around the Shiny output function. Animations automatically show/hide when the output
is recalculating/recalculated. You can use your own custom image, or choose from 8 different types of
built-in animations, as well customize the color and size of the built-in animations.
